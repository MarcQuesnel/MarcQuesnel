	<h2>Who Am I?</h2>

	<blockquote>I'm the captain of the starship <i>Enterprise.</i></blockquote> 
	</p>I have a lot of hair on my head (unlike some other Star Fleet captains I could name). 
	I'm a swash-buckler and a cowboy diplomat. 
	I'm a fighter <b>AND</b> a lover. Hire <strong>ME</strong> for your next mission.
	</p>
<br>	
	<h2>My Accomplishments</h2>
	<h3>My Fights</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Lots of Klingons</li>  
		<li>The Greek God Apollo</li>
		<li>Some blood sucking monster that could change shape</li>
		<li>Finnegan (an academy bully with a nasty left cross)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>My Loves</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Edith Keeler - she had to die to keep Hitler from taking over the world (it's a long story)</li>
		<li>Some android who was created by Brahms (that's another long story)</li>
		<li>An Indian girl whose planet was about to be destroyed by a comet </li>
		<li>Some alien with blue skin.</li>
		<li>Ruth (That's all. Just Ruth.)</li>
	</ol>
<h3> What my friends say about me </h3>

	</p>Spock:</p>

	<blockquote>"You're a captain, not a miracle worker Jim"</blockquote>
